    "The standard deviation is about 362869 and it is too big. This means that data points vary a lot and there are some outliers. It is true because when I see 'Sale Price' column, the minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 71,000,000. Therefore, the plots does not look very informative since the plots have to display all data points in a wide range. One possible way to overcome this is to take the logarithm of all values. Then extremely large value will decrease so the range of values become much narrower. Also, it is impossible that the sale price is $1. We need to search why 1 was given and replace this value with meaningful value or drop that row."

    "Unfortunately, simply fixing these missing values isn't sufficient for using `Roof Material` in our model.  Since `Roof Material` is a categorical variable, we will have to one-hot-encode the data.  Notice in the example code below that we have to pre-specify the categories. For more information on categorical data in pandas, refer to this [link](https://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/user_guide/categorical.html). For more information on why we want to use one-hot-encoding, refer to this [link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following function `ohe_roof_material` that returns a dataframe with the new column one-hot-encoded on the roof material of the household. These new columns should have the form `x0_MATERIAL`. Your function should return a new DataFrame, not modify the existing DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You should **avoid using `pd.get_dummies`** in your solution as it will remove your original column and is therefore not as reusable as your constructed data preprocessing pipeline. Instead, you can one-hot-encode one column into multiple columns **using Scikit-learn's [One Hot Encoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)**.\n",

You will be well-prepared to build such a model: you have considered what is in this data set, what it can be used for, and engineered some features that should be useful for prediction. Creating a house-pricing model for Cook County has some challenging social implications to think, though, however. This will be addressed in an upcoming lecture and next week's discussion."
